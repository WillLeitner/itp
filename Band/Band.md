I didn't have much play in the programming. We started by taking the source for the sample website and replacing their information with ours. I then hastily created a terrible song to put on the website as our single "Solitude in T minor," and sent it to Roy to be added into the site. I then wrote our three bios, Roy put them in the site, and then I wrote the reviews directly into the html file. Ultimately I think I contributed just as much as my team members, just not in the specifics of the programming. I was working the whole time, between the song and the bios, but I didn't do much with the coding and I definitely could've done more. I think Gavin and Roy did a great job on the assignment, really working to build a great and nice-looking website. Because of the split of responsibility, I didn't really run into any issues. I just made a silly song on Cubase and wrote some bios on Google Docs. I helped a bit with lining up the logo blurb and making that look nice, but otherwise my work was smoothsailing.
