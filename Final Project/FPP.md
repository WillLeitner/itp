## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Smushy's Big Day

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project a web-based synthesizer.")

I'll make a visual novel with Ren'Py about a character going on an adevnture. It'll be a choose-your-own-adventure, where different choices lead to different outcomes.

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

The Python Textbook, GitHub repositories, Youtube tutorials

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The game will consist of backdrops and characters, along with text boxes telling the story and reading dialogue. Occasionally, the player will be faced with choices, for example going to the beach or going to the forest. Choosing one or the other could vastly affect the outcome of your story. When the player reaches a certain ending, they will be presented with an ending screen, with each ending having it's own unique visual. I will make the visuals out of PlayDo becasue I think that's fun.

## Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class? For another class? Who is the professor in this class?

Not for a specific class, but it will allow me to work on video game scoring, which is my intended career.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

At the very least, I'd like to have about 10 minutes of gameplay that can lead to 3-5 potential endings. I want the visuals to look good and the story to actually be somewhat entertaining.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would mean a grander story, with closer to 10 unique endings. I'd want the music to build and change a lot more than what would likely be a pretty basic soundtrack in lowest tier outcome. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If everything works out perfectly, I'd want an in depth story with maybe around 15 endings and dynamic music that seamless changes with the plot points and scenery. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I think the choose-your-own-adventure aspect will be pretty straight-forward. Different choices will log different variables which can be called back later when they would change the story. If I want to create dynamic music, I will likely have to research the coding for this, as I don't think we'll be touching on it in class. 
Over the next week I'll plot out the story, aiming to have this done by next Tuesday, the 19th. I'll buy all the PlayDo I need next weekend and start working on some of the models for the game. I'll aim to have the first few scenes/choices done before the following class on the 26th. I'll take Thanksgiving break to keep working through the scenes and finalize the story and dialogue. When we get back from break I'll start working on the music and researching how to make the music dynamic, seamlessly changing with some of the choices/scenes. I'll try to write all of the music over that next week while working through more of the scenes and story, before class on the 3rd. The next week, I'll finish up on the scenes and the visuals and do my best with incorporating the music.
